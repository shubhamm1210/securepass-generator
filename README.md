# SecurePass – Password Generator 🔐

SecurePass is a frontend password generator that creates strong random passwords based on user-defined length.

Passwords generated by this application are considered strong because they are created using random character combinations rather than predictable human patterns.

## Why the Passwords Are Strong
The strength of the generated password depends on:
- Random selection of characters, which prevents pattern-based guessing
- Use of mixed character types such as letters, numbers, and symbols
- Adjustable password length, where longer passwords significantly increase security

Each generated password is independent and unique, making it resistant to common brute-force and dictionary attacks.

## Key Concepts Used
1. HTML – Structure of the application  
2. CSS – Styling and layout  
3. JavaScript  
   - DOM Manipulation  
   - `Math.random()` for random password generation
